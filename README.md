# Youtube-Transcript-Summarizer

In this project, we get transcripts/subtitles for a given YouTube video Id using a Python API, perform text summarization on obtained transcripts using Hugging Face transformers, build a Flask backend REST API to expose the summarization service to the client and develop a Chrome extension which will utilize the backend API to display summarized text to the user.
